            <h3>Who </h3>
            <p> is ARC? We are the Athletics & Recreation Centre. This is an
                exciting venture for our Algonquin Community. This facility
                will provide our students with a place to break through
                perceptual barriers in a welcoming, safe, inclusive and
                inviting environment for students of all backgrounds,
                cultures and abilities to spark a movement.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What </h3>
            <p>
                is this going to cost me? This facility will be included in your
                activity fee. All fee-paying students can use and participate
                in all activities in the building. As for the facility, it will cost
                Algonquin College $48.8 million.

            <h3>Where</h3>
            <p>

                northeast of the Student Commons building, opposite of the
                residence. The facility will be an estimated 100,000 square
                feet! Connected to the Student Commons by a "Plus 15'
