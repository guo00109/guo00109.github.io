# web portfolio

## Objective
This webpage was designed by me at the beginning of this semester. The teacher asked us to redesign a webpage. I chose whychristmas?
The website. Com, I finally chose to make this website because I like the pictures and colors I chose this time.
It's still hard to resize images when writing code, so you end up with an imperfect page.

For font, [font](https://github.com/guo00109/guo00109.github.io/tree/master/fonts) .
